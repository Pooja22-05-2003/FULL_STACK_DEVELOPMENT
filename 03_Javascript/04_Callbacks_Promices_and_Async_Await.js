// async await is better than promise chains
// promise chains is better than callback hell

/*
Terms Studied:
1. Synchronous in Javascript
2. Asynchronous Programming in Javascript
3. CallBack Function
4. Callback hell (It is a problem in javascript in which nested callbacks stacked below one another formaing a pyramid structure(Pyramid of Doom))
// This Type of Programming becomes difficult to understand and manage.

5. For solving this callback hell problem we have solution as promises.
